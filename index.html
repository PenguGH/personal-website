        <h2>Some Fun Facts about me.</h2>
        <p>My favorite anime and show ever is Dragon Ball Z! I remember it being one of the first anime I ever watched and was immediately pulled in by the great story telling, characters, adventure, and action. The original Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z are masterpieces. While Dragon Ball GT and Dragon Ball Super did not meet the high expecations set by its predecessors, they each brought some interesting ideas to the series.</p>

        <p> I want to own a corgi someday and more specifically a Pembroke Welsh Corgi. Corgis are a fun, energetic, and intelligent breed. They like puzzles which I share that interest as well.</p>

        </div>

        <p>My favorite food is ramen, tonkotsu ramen is made with a filling pork bone broth, noodles, char siu, egg, bamboo shoots, woodear mushrooms, spring onions, and seaweed. Great for a cold day!</p>
